Quick dirty notes on required behavior:

- We should follow Ansible's scope and var shadowing behavior wherever
  possible.
  - This means e.g. slave_zones is shadowed by declarations further
    down in the tree.
  - Ansible's understanding of slave_zones for a host is correct _iff_
    the host is master in its cluster.
    - If a host is not master, it slaves the slave_zones zones from
       its master, and also slaves the cluster's own zones from its
       master.
  - master_zones and offer_zones are only meaningful for a
    bottom-level cluster declaration. We should do error checking for this.
  - For each host we should build another variable _slave_zones that
    is a dictionary where each entry has zone as key and IP address as
    value
  - 


Primitives:

- get all zones mastered by a cluster
- get all zones known about by a cluster #FIXME decompose
  - There is a lot to be said here if the goal is to maintain
    proximity to source of truth
